      The past year I have been working on studying path planning in single- and multi-robot settings. Here are some algorithms I've implemented recently (current research posted later).
      <br><br>

      M* for nonholonomic robots with ROS/Gazebo (<a href="http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/papers/paperUploads/iros2011_wagner.pdf">Wagner et al.</a>):
      <br>
      M* is a search-based planning algorithm for multi-robot settings, based on A*, M* guarantees optimal paths, and minimizes expansions from A* by only expanding states when collisions are detected.

      <br><br>

      HRVO using CUDA (<a href="http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/HRVO/">Snape et al.</a>):
      <br>
      HRVO (Hybrid Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles) is a method to model moving obstacles, new velocities are chosen that lie outside obstacle boundaries for collision avoidance. This method is highly-parallelizable. More details at: <a href="https://github.com/arizonat/CIS565-FinalProject">https://github.com/arizonat/CIS565-FinalProject</a>

      <br><br>

      CAPT for quadrotors (<a href="http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/33/1/98.abstract">Turpin et al.</a>):
      <br>
      CAPT assumes agents are "unlabeled", so any agent can pick any goal (rather than having a specific goal as in traditional multi-robot planning settings). This allows us to optimally select goals for each agent using the hunagarian algorithm.

	As an undergrad, I was on the <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~fsae/">Penn Formula SAE team (site not up to date)</a> where I worked on the electronics and eventually was the subteam lead for the 2011 season. Our team consisted of Ryan Kumbang, Karan Desai, Nisan Lerea, and myself (+tons of help from alums and help from Keith and Praveer). Our team had historically one of the most custom electronic systems (self made CAN, boards, etc...). I was in charge of making sure our shift (pneumatics), clutch (linear actuator), ECU, etc...operated smoothly.

      In order to save on weight and space, we condensed all the major electronics components besides the motors/pistons/steering wheel into a little box on the back of the car.

      <p>
	Most of our electronics system is based off of the same CAN-based technology used in Modlab on the CKbots to make it modular.

	Worked in Modlab for several years developing software for their CKbots. The CKbots are modular robots that allow us to create arbitrary robot configurations (2 examples below from the Modlab site):

      <img src="../img/projects/ckbot2.jpg">
      <p>
	I worked on earlier versions of the CKbots that communicated via CAN-bus, but required manual screw connections. There were some versions that used magentic faces to connect and disconnect automatically, but I did not interface with those versions.
      </p>

      <p>
      Implemented a series of high- and low-level software interfaces in Linux for the CKbots, primarily in Python and C (for the embedded portions). Worked closely with Dr. Shai Revzen and Jimmy Sastra. Enabled specification of gaits, combining gaits, monitoring CAN bus, etc... For more general information about the CKbots: <a href="http://modlabupenn.org/ckbot/">modlabupenn.org/ckbot</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      The communication between modules was based off of the Robotics Bus Protocol detailed <a href="http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=852709">here</a>.

	In undergrad I was also a member of the UPennalizers RoboCup SPL team. The RoboCup SPL league is an international competition where ~24 teams compete in robotic humanoid soccer using a standard platform, the Naos.

      <p>
	Here I worked primarily on the vision systems for the Nao robots, making sure they could see the (correct) ball, localize, etc. I implemented features such as multi-line detection using Hough transforms and horizon detection using odometry. I was the vision lead for the 2010 competition in Singapore where we made it to the quarter-finals (and beat many of the other top teams!) See a sample goal from the competition below.

To find out more competition details check out <a href="http://www.robockey.com">www.robockey.com</a>. We made it to the quarter finals. I primarily worked on the entire electrical portion, but also helped with parts of the mechanical and software portions as well. Here's a compilation of our matches:

	I spent ~1.25 years at IBM: Systems and Technology group as a software gngineer developing mobile applications for server management, specifically for the Flex Systems offering. Using Dojo and Cordova we built a JavaScript-based "native" application that ran on iOS, Android, and BlackBerry phones and tablets. The app allowed users to monitor and control (turn on/off/reboot) their servers. The Flex group has since been sold to Lenovo, but here are some screenshots of the product.
